Yesterday I applied to Google in response to their visit to ANU. And today
got a response from them telling me that I'm not getting an interview.

Here's the email:

> Hi Yusuf,
>
>Thank you for applying to the Software Engineer, University Graduate - Sydney role. We carefully reviewed your background and experience, and decided not to proceed with your application.
>
>Although it didn't work out this time, we may contact you if we come across another opening that we think could interest you and may be a good match for your skills and experience. Thanks again for your interest in opportunities at Google. We wish you the best of luck in your search.
 
It's hilarious and frustrating at the same time, since they don't even bother
trying to find out what I'm really into. Well, I think that's the way it goes.

Start considering creating a startup instead of applying for another job...
